# Integrate Back-End Interview Exercise
## Overview
The center of Integrate's product is the Demand Acceleration Platform (DAP). DAP allows users to interact with marketing lead data. A marketing lead is a person who shows interest in a company's products or services. Our customers need marketing leads that are correct and likely to generate business.

We are striving to build a world-class application with microservices that expose their functionality through RESTful APIs.

## Exercise Definition
It is important to us that your interview exercise is relevant to the kind of work you would be performing at Integrate.

For this exercise, you will be asked to create a simple RESTful API using C#. This repo provides a working solution for you to use as a base.

1. The RESTful API should include a data model that consists of a Person class with the following properties:
    * First Name (mandatory)
    * Last Name (mandatory)
    * Email (mandatory)
    * Company (optional)
    * ZIP Code (optional)
    * Phone Number (mandatory)
    * Date Created

2. A persistent datastore isn't required. The datastore can instead be memory-based. But, the code should be designed in such a way that a persistent datastore could be substituted later.
3. The API should allow the user to retrieve all people stored in the DB.
4. The API should allow the user to add a new person to the DB.
